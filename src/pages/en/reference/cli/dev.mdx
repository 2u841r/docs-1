Runs Astro's development server. This is a local HTTP server that doesn't bundle assets. It uses Hot Module Replacement (HMR) to update your browser as you save changes in your editor.

<h3>Flags</h3>

Use these flags to customize the behavior of the Astro dev server. For flags shared with other Astro commands, see [common flags](#common-flags) below.

#### `--port <number>`

Specifies which port to run on. Defaults to `3000`.

#### `--host [optional host address]`

Sets which network IP addresses the dev server should listen on (i.e. non-localhost IPs). This can be useful for testing your project on local devices like a mobile phone during development.

- `--host` — listen on all addresses, including LAN and public addresses
- `--host <custom-address>` — expose on a network IP address at `<custom-address>`

:::caution
Do not use the `--host` flag to expose the dev server in a production environment. The dev server is designed for local use while developing your site only.
