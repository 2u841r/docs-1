Control whether Markdown draft pages should be included in the build.

A Markdown page is considered a draft if it includes `draft: true` in its frontmatter. Draft pages are always included & visible during development (`astro dev`) but by default they will not be included in your final build.

```js
{
  markdown: {
    // Example: Include all drafts in your final build
    drafts: true,
  }
}
```
