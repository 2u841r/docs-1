<DontEditWarning />

<p>
**Type:** `undefined`



</p>

The base path to deploy to. Astro will use this path as the root for your pages and assets both in development and in production build.

In the example below, `astro dev` will start your server at `/docs`.

```js
{
  base: '/docs'
}
```

When using this option, all of your static asset imports and URLs should add the base as a prefix. You can access this value via `import.meta.env.BASE_URL`.

```astro
<a href="/docs/about/">About</a>
<img src=`${import.meta.env.BASE_URL}/image.png`>
```
