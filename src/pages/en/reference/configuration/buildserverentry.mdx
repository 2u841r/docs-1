<DontEditWarning />

<p>
**Type:** `undefined`

**Default:** `'entry.mjs'`

</p>

Specifies the file name of the server entrypoint when building to SSR.
This entrypoint is usually dependent on which host you are deploying to and
will be set by your adapter for you.

Note that it is recommended that this file ends with `.mjs` so that the runtime
detects that the file is a JavaScript module.

```js
{
  build: {
    serverEntry: 'main.mjs'
  }
}
```
