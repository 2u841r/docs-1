Extend Astro with custom integrations. Integrations are your one-stop-shop for adding framework support (like Solid.js), new features (like sitemaps), and new libraries (like Partytown and Turbolinks).

Read our [Integrations Guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/) for help getting started with Astro Integrations.

```js
import react from '@astrojs/react';
import tailwind from '@astrojs/tailwind';
{
  // Example: Add React + Tailwind support to Astro
  integrations: [react(), tailwind()]
}
```
