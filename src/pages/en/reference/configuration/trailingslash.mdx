<DontEditWarning />

<p>
**Type:** `undefined`

**Default:** `'ignore'`

</p>

Set the route matching behavior of the dev server. Choose from the following options:
  - `'always'` - Only match URLs that include a trailing slash (ex: "/foo/")
  - `'never'` - Never match URLs that include a trailing slash (ex: "/foo")
  - `'ignore'` - Match URLs regardless of whether a trailing "/" exists

Use this configuration option if your production host has strict handling of how trailing slashes work or do not work.

You can also set this if you prefer to be more strict yourself, so that URLs with or without trailing slashes won't work during development.

```js
{
  // Example: Require a trailing slash during development
  trailingSlash: 'always'
}
```
