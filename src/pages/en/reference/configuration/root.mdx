<DontEditWarning />

<p>
**Type:** `undefined`
**CLI:** `--root`
**Default:** `"."` (current working directory)

</p>

You should only provide this option if you run the `astro` CLI commands in a directory other than the project root directory. Usually, this option is provided via the CLI instead of the [Astro config file](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/configuring-astro/#supported-config-file-types), since Astro needs to know your project root before it can locate your config file.

If you provide a relative path (ex: `--root: './my-project'`) Astro will resolve it against your current working directory.

#### Examples

```js
{
  root: './my-project-directory'
}
```
```bash
$ astro build --root ./my-project-directory
```
