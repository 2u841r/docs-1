title: "SSR vs. SSG"

Astro is a web framework that supports both static (SSG) and server (SSR) rendering modes. Either approach to deployment can render a fast website, but they each have different strengths and weaknesses. 

To choose the right mode for your project, it can help to understand the differences between the two approaches when you go to deploy your website.

## Static Site Generation (SSG)

Static site generation (SSG) is a popular way to build content-driven websites. Static sites are built ahead of time using the `astro build` command, and the output of your build is a collection of static HTML files (along with other site assets like CSS and JavaScript). Once you deploy your static website, your server or CDN simply sends the same page HTML to every visitor.

SSG is a great choice for content-heavy sites that update infrequently (or semi-frequently) and display the same page content to all visitors. Because static sites are static, they are relatively simple and straightforward to host behind a CDN that can serve your pages fast, globally. CDNs are also inexpensive (and somtimes free!) to host with.

Almost all Astro features work with static sites, including [View Transitions](/en/guides/view-transitions/) and [islands](/en/concepts/islands/) for interactive UI and Embedded SPAs. But some features -- like reading dynamic query parameters from the URL (`?foo=42`) and live [data fetching](/en/guides/data-fetching/) --  can't work without a server.

**SSG is the default rendering mode for Astro.** Unless you tell us otherwise, Astro will build your site as a static site when you run `astro build`. If this default behavior is too limiting for your project, keep reading to learn how to enable server rendering with a few lines of configuration.

:::tip[Summary]
Astro's default `static` render mode is a powerful, modern-feeling choice for content-heavy sites that update infrequently, and display the same page content to all visitors.
:::

```js title="astro.config.mjs" ins="static"
// Note: This is Astro's default build behavior if no `output` is specified.
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';

export default defineConfig({
  output: 'static'
});
```

If your website requires a dynamic API or page content that changes often, a static site may be too limiting. In that case, you'll want to consider a server runtime for your build.

## Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

Server-side rendering (SSR) is a popular way to build dynamic websites, web apps, and APIs. SSR involves building a response on-demand using a hosted server so that every request can be unique. When you run `astro build` with a server render mode configured, Astro will generate your static assets alongside a server application that can be deployed to a hosted server or serverless environment.

Server-side rendering is a great choice for websites that update frequently or require dynamic content, like user-specific page content or any other live data from a database. Servers are also a great choice for building backend APIs, especially when live data or user authentication is required.

Servers are more complex to deploy and maintain than static sites, but they are also more powerful. If you understand the tradeoff and need the additional power of a server, then consider enabling server rendering in your Astro project. 

:::tip[Summary]
Astro's on demand `server` render mode enables more powerful websites and web apps with dynamic content, user authentication, and backend APIs (at the expense of greater deployment complexity).
:::

```js title="astro.config.mjs" ins={2, 5-6}
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import vercel from '@astrojs/vercel/serverless';

export default defineConfig({
  output: 'server',
  adapter: vercel(),
});
```

## Hybrid Rendering

Astro has a third rendering mode called `hybrid` that combines together the strengths of both static and server rendering. Hybrid rendering is best for websites that are *mostly* static but require some dynamic pages or API endpoints to be included. This mirrors the behavior of a static website, which can also be useful for anyone migrating an existing static Astro project to the server for the first time.

When you run `astro build` with a hybrid render mode configured, Astro will generate a server application that is almost identical to the `server` rendering mode. The only difference between `hybrid` and `server` output modes is that your pages and API endpoints are all prerendered by default during the build step for faster response times.

:::tip[Summary]
Astro's on demand `hybrid` render mode is almost identical to the `server` mode. The main difference is that pages and API endpoints default to prerendering during the build, for faster (but static) pages as the default route behavior.
:::

```js title="astro.config.mjs" ins="hybrid"
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import vercel from '@astrojs/vercel/serverless';

export default defineConfig({
  output: 'hybrid',
  adapter: vercel(),
});
```
