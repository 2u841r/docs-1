**Embedded SPAs** are a pattern for building local, client-side web applications in Astro. 

## What is an SPA?

The Single-Page Application (or SPA) is a pattern for building client-side web applications that take over the entire page once they load. SPAs are powerful, but heavy and slow to load due to their over-reliance on client-side JavaScript. 

An SPA works best for a user-experience that is long-lived and highly interactive, like an admin or SaaS app. An SPA is not a good fit for a website that is primarily content-driven where page-load speed is important, like a content or marketing site.

## What is an Embedded SPA?

By default, Astro uses server-rendered HTML for a fast first-page load performance that is SEO friendly by default. JavaScript is only sent to the browser on a per-island basis, allowing for interactive components on an otherwise static page.

But sometimes you still need to build something even more interactive and app-like than combining individual UI components on a page. Astro's solution for this is the **embedded SPA: a complete JavaScript app rendered as a single island, often as the only component on an Astro page**.

An Embedded SPA can be added to your website just like any other interactive island on the page, and can take over an entire Astro page, or even your entire site. However, Astro's multi-page architecture allows you to seamlessly combine an embedded SPA (e.g. a user dashboard) on one page with other pages: a static contact page, dynamic blog pages that fetch content from a CMS, and even other embedded SPAs.

<MyReactApp client:load />
```

## Migrating an Existing SPA to Astro

One of the most powerful use-cases for Embedded SPAs in Astro is migrating an existing SPA to Astro. 

Migrating an existing SPA to Astro lets you take advantage of all of the features of Astro while keeping your code-base mostly as-is with as few changes as possible needed to be up and running. With Astro powering your SPA you can now add an API, or pull out a few pages from the SPA that would perform better as server-rendered HTML powered by Astro.

For example, you can [embed an existing Create React App project](/en/guides/migrate-to-astro/from-create-react-app/) into an Astro project in just a few steps!



## Adding an API

Because an Embedded SPA runs in the browser, it needs to connect with the server to fetch data. If you already have an external API that you can connect to, then great! Otherwise, Astro supports building your server API alongside your Embedded SPA in the same Astro project with [API endpoints](/en/core-concepts/endpoints/).
