**Embedded SPAs** are a pattern for building local, client-side web applications in Astro. 

## What is an SPA?

The Single-Page Application (or SPA) is a pattern for building client-side web applications that take over the entire page once they load. SPAs are powerful, but heavy and slow to load due to their over-reliance on client-side JavaScript. 

An SPA works best for a user-experience that is long-lived and highly interactive, like an admin or SaaS app. An SPA is not a good fit for a website that is primarily content-driven where page-load speed is important, like a content or marketing site.

## What is an Embedded SPA?

Astro is most often associated with server-rendered HTML and fast first-page load performance, but sometimes you still need to build something more interactive and app-like. Enter: the embedded SPA.

Embedded SPAs let you build web apps with Astro that leverage the existing [island](/en/concepts/islands/) architecture. An Embedded SPA can be added to your website just like any other interactive island on the page (except this island is often the entire page itself). You are free to have many different SPAs in a single Astro project, and each one can be as large or as small as you need it to be. 


```astro title="src/pages/admin/[...catchall].astro" ins="client:load"
<MyReactApp client:load />
```

## Migrating an Existing SPA to Astro

One of the most powerful use-cases for Embedded SPAs in Astro is migrating an existing SPA to Astro. You can embed an existing Create React App project into an Astro project in just a few steps! (Link to migration guide)

Migrating an existing SPA to Astro lets you take advantage of all the features of Astro while keeping your code-base mostly as-is with as few changes as possible. With Astro powering your SPA you can now add an API, or migrate out a few pages from the SPA that would do better as server-rendered HTML powered by Astro. 

## Adding an API

Because an Embedded SPA runs in the browser, it needs to connect with the server to fetch data. If you already have an external API that you can connect to, then great! Otherwise, Astro supports building your server API alongside your Embedded SPA in the same Astro project with [API endpoints](/en/core-concepts/endpoints/).
