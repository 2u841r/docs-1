**Astro** is the web framework for building **content-first websites**, **powerful web applications**, **dynamic server APIs**, and everything in between. 

An Astro site scales with you:
- Build a single-page portfolio, then expand it with a blog.
- Build a SaaS marketing website, then add your demo, docs, a shopping cart, authentication and a user dashboard for a complete solution.
- (third huge thing - like Statsmuse )

Astro's [component-based island architecture](/en/concepts/islands) lets you [pre-render as much much as possible](/en/core-concepts/rendering-modes/). This gives you [full flexibility and control over the JavaScript you send to the browser](/en/reference/directives-reference/#client-directives): how much, when, and even [from which UI framework](/en/core-concepts/framework-components/). 

By default, an Astro site will get your content in front of your reader quickly, consume fewer resources, and even let you [bring existing projects](/en/concepts/embedded-web-apps/).

Today, Astro is used by companies and agencies all over the world including [Google, Cloudflare, and Trivago](https://astro.build/showcase/) while also voted by developers as the [2023 Audience Choice winner at GitHub Universe](https://github.blog/2023-11-09-celebrating-the-github-awards-2023-recipients/#audience-choice-award) as an open-source project that has helped them create an impact.

With our [beginner-friendly introductory tutorial](/en/tutorial/0-introduction/), Astro is for everyone.
