Astro does not run JavaScript at build time for Markdown or MDX files. The frontmatter in these files is typically used for metadata like layout, title, etc., and not for running scripts. However, you can run JavaScript at build time in an Astro component's frontmatter. 

If you want to run a script at build time for a Markdown page, you can convert that page to an Astro component and import your Markdown content. Alternatively, you can include the script in the frontmatter of the `.md` file's layout component.
