How do I add a stylesheet from a CDN to Starlight?
:::

To add a custom stylesheet to the `<head>` of your Starlight site, use the head configuration option.

This option allows you to add custom tags to the `<head>` of your site, which can be useful for adding stylesheets, analytics, and other third-party scripts and resources.

Here's how you can do it:

```js title ="astro.config.mjs"
starlight({
  head: [
    {
      tag: 'link',
      attrs: {
        rel: 'stylesheet',
        href: 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.16.10/dist/katex.css',
        integrity: 'sha384-K1E1xaIzoWihlXfiT5fcmLNabsnrl+dqc0errnRwtMX14tKRA9cCYNDGnXiHEZMs',
        crossorigin: 'anonymous',
      },
    },
  ],
});
```
In this configuration, tag is the HTML tag you want to add (link in this case), attrs is an object containing the attributes you want to add to the tag, and content is the content of the tag, if any.

Please note that entries in head are converted directly to HTML elements and do not pass through Astroâ€™s script or style processing. If you need to import local assets like scripts, styles, or images, you might need to override the Head component.
