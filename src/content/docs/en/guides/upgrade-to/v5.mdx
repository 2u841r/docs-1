:::note[Need to continue?]
After upgrading Astro, you may not need to make any changes to your project at all!

But, if you notice errors or unexpected behavior, please check below for what has changed that might need updating in your project.
:::

Astro v5.0 includes [potentially breaking changes](#breaking-changes), as well as the [removal of some previously deprecated features](#previously-deprecated-features-now-removed). 

If your project doesn't work as expected after upgrading to v5.0, check this guide for an overview of all breaking changes and instructions on how to update your codebase.

See [the changelog](https://github.com/withastro/astro/blob/main/packages/astro/CHANGELOG.md) for full release notes. 

// WILL THE CHANGELOG SHOW BETA RELEASE NOTES?? IF NOT WHERE SPECIFICALLY TO LOOK?

## Astro v5.0 Experimental Flags Removed

The following features are no longer experimental in Astro v5.0: `actions`, `directRenderScript`, `globalRoutePriority`, `rewrites`, `env`, `serverIslands`.

Remove their experimental flags if you were previously using them, and move your `env` configuration to the root of your Astro config:

```js del={5-12} ins={14-16} title="astro.config.mjs"
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';

export default defineConfig({
  experimental: {
    actions: true,
    directRenderScript: true,
    globalRoutePriority: true,
    rewrites: true,
    serverIslands: true,
    env: {
      schema: {...}
    }
  },
  env: {
      schema: {...}
  }
})
```

These features are all available by default in Astro v5.0. Only `astro:env` requires any configuration to use.

Read about these exciting features and more in [the v5.0-beta Blog post](https://astro.build/blog/astro-4/). 

:::note
These features are still experimental in the current stable version of Astro. You can continue to find their official documentation in the [Experimental flags section](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#experimental-flags) of the configuration reference page.
:::

## Upgrades

// THESE ARE FOR DEPENDENCY UPGRADES

Any major upgrades to Astro's dependencies may cause breaking changes in your project.

### Upgraded: Vite 5.0

Placeholder

#### What should I do?

If you are using Vite-specific plugins, configuration, or APIs, check the [Vite migration guide](https://vitejs.dev/guide/migration) for their breaking changes and upgrade your project as needed. There are no breaking changes to Astro itself.

### Upgraded: minimum Node version

Astro v5.0 requires Node v18.17.1 and higher.

#### What should I do?

 Check that both your development environment and your deployment environment are using **Node `18.17.1` or higher**.

<Steps>
1. Check your local version of Node using:

    ```sh
    node -v
    ```

2. Check your [deployment environment's](/en/guides/deploy/) own documentation to verify that they support Node xx.

    You can specify Node `18.17.1` for your Astro project either in a dashboard configuration setting or a `.nvmrc` file.

    ```bash title=".nvmrc"
    x.x.x
    ```
</Steps>

## Breaking Changes

The following changes are considered breaking changes in Astro v5.0. Breaking changes may or may not provide temporary backwards compatibility.

:::note

**These 5.0-beta changes conflict with the rest of Astro's documentation.**

The following content is **not**  consistent with the rest of Astro Docs. The main docs will be updated for the v5.0 **stable** release only.
:::
 
{/* If you need to refer to the documentation for a v4.x project, you can browse this [(unmaintained) snapshot of the docs from before v4.0 was released](https://docs-git-v3-docs-unmaintained-astrodotbuild.vercel.app/). */}

### Removed: some public-facing types (PLT-844)

In Astro v4.x, `@types/astro.ts` exposed all types publicly to users, whether or not they were still actively used or only intended for internal use.

Astro v5.0 refactors this file to [remove outdated and internal types (link to PR for all the messy details if it's too long to list here)](). This refactor brings improvements to your editor (faster completions, lower memory use, more relevant completion options). However, this refactor may cause errors in some projects that have been relying on types that are no longer available to the public.

#### What should I do?

Remove any types that now cause errors in your project. You no longer have access to these.

### Changed: CSRF protection is now set by default (PLT2262)

In Astro v4.0, The default value of `security.checkOrigin` was `false`. Previously, you had to explicitly set this value to `true` to enable Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection.

Astro v5.0 changes the default value  of this option to `true`, and will automatically check that the "origin" header matches the URL sent by each request in on-demand rendered pages.

#### What should I do?

If you had previously configured `security.checkOrigin: true`, you no longer need this line in your Astro config. This is now the default.

To disable this behaviour, you must explicitly set  `security.checkOrigin: false`.

```js title="astro.config.mjs" del={3-5}
export default defineConfig({
  output: "server",
  security: {
    checkOrigin: true
  }
})
```

### Changed: `--mode` usage (PLT2220)

Rethink `--mode` and internal mode usage

#### What should I do?

Stuff!

### Changed: add base to `paginate` (PLT2204)

Add base to `paginate`

#### What should I do?

Stuff!

### Changed: name for CLI command `sync` (PLT2214)

COnsider renaming the CLI command `sync`

#### What should I do?

Stuff!

### Changed: auto-inject `<meta charset="utf-8">` by default for every astro/md/mdx/html (PLT1057)

Decide if charset=utf-8 should not be set for md/mdx pages by default

#### What should I do?

Stuff!

### Changed: `astro:content` can no longer be used on the client (PLT2118)

Prevent use of `astro:content` on the client

#### What should I do?

Stuff!

### Changed: `astro:config:setup` now passes `AstroUserConfig` so integrations can change config (PLT1776)

#### What should I do?

Stuff!

### Changed: set `ssr.external: true` when using Vite to load configs (PLT1631)

To consider - set `ssr.external: true` when using Vite to load configs

#### What should I do?

Stuff!

### Changed: `<script type="module">` no longer implies `is:inline` (PLT1548)

COnsider supporting `type="module"` for people who want to set it explicitly

#### What should I do?

Stuff!

### Removed: top level await in `vite-plugin-markdown`'s `astro:assets` (PLT1323)

## Deprecated

The following deprecated features are no longer supported and are no longer documented. Please update your project accordingly.

Some deprecated features may temporarily continue to function until they are completely removed. Others may silently have no effect, or throw an error prompting you to update your code.

### Deprecated: `functionPerRoute` (Adapter API) (PLT2150)

In Astro v4.x, you could opt in to creating a separate file for each route defined in the project, mirroring your `src/pages/` directory in the build folder. By default, Astro emitted a single `entry.mjs` file, which was responsible for emitting the rendered page on each request.

Astro v5.0 removes the option to opt out of the default behavior. This behavior is now standard, and non-configurable.


#### What should I do?

Remove the `functionPerRoute` property from your `adapterFeatures` configuration. It is no longer available.

```js title="my-adapter.mjs" del={10}
export default function createIntegration() {
  return {
    name: '@matthewp/my-adapter',
    hooks: {
      'astro:config:done': ({ setAdapter }) => {
        setAdapter({
          name: '@matthewp/my-adapter',
          serverEntrypoint: '@matthewp/my-adapter/server.js',
          adapterFeatures: {
              functionPerRoute: true
          }
        });
      },
    },
  };
}

```

### Deprecated: `build.format=file` (PLT1444)

In Astro v4.x, 

Astro v5.0 removes the option 


#### What should I do?

Choose a different value

### Deprecated: The Lit integration (integrations) (PLT2146)

In Astro v4.x, 

Astro v5.0 removes the integration 


#### What should I do?

Choose a different value

### Deprecated: `define:vars` (core) (PLT2145)

In Astro v4.x, 

Astro v5.0 removes the directive 


#### What should I do?

Choose a different value

## Previously deprecated features now removed

The following deprecated features have now been entirely removed from the code base and can no longer be used. Some of these features may have continued to work in your project even after deprecation. Others may have silently had no effect.

Projects now containing these removed features will be unable to build, and there will no longer be any supporting documentation prompting you to remove these features.
