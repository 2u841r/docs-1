## Manage hosted production databases

Astro DB offers [database hosting](https://astro.build/db/) to a globally distributed network with a free Astro Studio account.

The Astro Studio dashboard provides access to all of your [`@astrojs/db`](/en/guides/integrations-guide/db/) hosted database projects. From here, you can view, manage and deploy hosted remote data.

### Visual data views

On the interactive Studio dashboard, you can explore and manage your data in a visual spreadsheet, a rich text editor, or raw SQL console.

### Use remote development data

A Studio database project syncs with your database config and uses your remote database as your development data instead seeding from the `db/seed.ts` file. Configuration changes are automatically handled when setting up a GitHub project with a CI action, but can also be synced manually using the `astro db` CLI commands:

- `astro login`

- `astro link`

- `astro db gen`

- `astro db push`

### Write to your hosted database

Writable tables require a hosted database to persist input between builds of your website. A Studio account unlocks writable data, a simple database migration flow, and a complete UI dashboard to manage production data.

With an Astro Studio account, you can perform actions such as inserting data from an on-demand rendered server route. For example, a reader of your blog can submit a form to add a new comment:

```astro
---
// src/pages/index.astro
import { db, Comment } from 'astro:db';

if (Astro.request.method === 'POST') {
  // parse form data
  const formData = await Astro.request.formData();
  const author = formData.get('author');
  const content = formData.get('content');
  if (typeof author === 'string' && typeof content === 'string') {
    // insert form data into the Comment table
    await db.insert(Comment).values({ author, content });
  }
}

// render the new list of comments on each request
const comments = await db.select().from(Comment);
---

<form method="POST" style="display: grid">
	<label for="author">Author</label>
	<input id="author" name="author" />

	<textarea name="content"></textarea>

	<button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>

<!--render `comments`-->
