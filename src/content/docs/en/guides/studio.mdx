The following stuff for Studio should be documented:

1. document the `login`, `logout`, and `link` commands
2. document the [studio.astro.build](http://studio.astro.build) web portal, and that it exists


## `astro login`

Authenticate with Astro Studio. This is required to run all project management commands, including [astro link](#astro-link).

## `astro link`

Link to your Studio project. This is required to run Astro DB commands for database management. To link a project, you will be prompted to select an existing project or create a new one.

## `astro logout`

Log out of Astro Studio and remove any locally stored authentication keys.
