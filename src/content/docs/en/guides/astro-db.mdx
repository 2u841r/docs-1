[Astro DB](https://astro.build/db/) is a fully-managed SQL database designed exclusively for Astro. Develop locally or connect to a hosted database managed on our [Astro Studio](https://studio.astro.build) platform.

## Installation

Add Astro DB to any new or existing Astro project with the [`@astrojs/db` integration](/en/guides/integrations-guide/db/) on npm. Astro includes a built-in `astro add` command to automate this setup process for you.

<PackageManagerTabs>
  <Fragment slot="npm">
  ```sh
  npx astro add db
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="pnpm">
  ```sh
  pnpm astro add db
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="yarn">
  ```sh
  yarn astro add db
  ```
  </Fragment>
</PackageManagerTabs>

If you prefer, you can [install `@astrojs/db` manually](/en/guides/integrations-guide/db/#manual-installation) instead.

## Define your database

TODO(fks): Anything to add here? A section on the technology maybe and how we spin up a database file for local development, instead of a heavy/complex server instance?

### Columns

TODO(fks): Introduce the concept of columns here and a brief summary of the ~5 that we support? Doesn't need to be long, but through this you can touch on the fact that Astro DB is a SQL database, which means columns exist. Let me know if I can come back to help write this section!

### Tables

Schemas enforce consistent columns within a database table. A schema guarantees that this data exists in a predictable form when you need to reference or query it.

Schemas also power Astro's automatic TypeScript typings for your content. When you define a schema for your table, Astro will automatically generate and apply a TypeScript interface to it. The result is full TypeScript support when you query your data, including property autocompletion and type-checking.

To configure an individual database table, import and use the `defineTable()` and `column` utilities from `astro:db`.

This example configures a `Comment` table with required text columns for `author` and `body` and then makes it available to your project through the `defineDb()` export.

```ts title="db/config.ts" "Comment"
import { defineDb, defineTable, column } from 'astro:db';

const Comment = defineTable({
  columns: {
    author: column.text(),
    body: column.text(),
  }
})

export default defineDb({
  tables: { Comment },
})
```

<ReadMore>See the [table configuration reference](/en/guides/integrations-guide/db/#table-configuration-reference) for a complete reference of table options.</ReadMore>

### Table References

Relationships between tables are a common pattern in database design. For example, a `Blog` table may be closely related to other tables of `Comment`, `Author`, and `Category`.

You can define these relations tables and save them into your database schema using **reference columns**. To establish a relationship, you will need:

- An **identifier column** on the referenced table. This is usually an `id` column with the `primaryKey` property.
- A column on the base table to **store the referenced `id`**. This uses the `references` property establish a relationship.

This example shows a `Comment` table's `authorId` column referencing an `Author` table's `id` column.

```ts title="db/config.ts" {3, 10}
const Author = defineTable({
  columns: {
    id: column.number({ primaryKey: true }),
    name: column.text(),
  }
});

const Comment = defineTable({
  columns: {
    authorId: column.number({ references: () => Author.columns.id }),
    content: column.text(),
  }
});
```

## Seed your database

In development, Astro will use your DB config to generate local types according to your schemas. These will be generated fresh each time the dev server is started, and will allow you to query and work with the shape of your data with type safety and autocompletion.

To seed development data for testing and debugging into your Astro project, create a `db/seed.ts` file. Import both the `db` object and any configured table from `astro:db`. Use the `db.insert()` function to provide an array of table row data objects.

The following example defines two rows of development data for a `Comment` table:

```ts title="db/seed.ts"
import { db, Comment } from 'astro:db';

export default async function() {
  await db.insert(Comment).values([
    { authorId: 1, body: 'Hope you like Astro DB!' },
    { authorId: 2, body: 'Enjoy!'},
  ])
}
```

Your development server will automatically restart your database whenever this file changes, regenerating your types and seeding your development data from `seed.ts`.

## Query your database

You can query your database from any [Astro page](/en/basics/astro-pages/#astro-pages) or [endpoint](/en/guides/endpoints/) in your project using the provided `db` ORM and query builder.


### Drizzle ORM

```
import {db} from 'astro:db';
```

Astro DB includes a built-in [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) client. There is no setup or manual  configuration required to use the client. The Astro DB `db` client is automatically configured for you to talk to your database (local or remote) when you run Astro. It is connected to your exact database schema definition, so that you get built-in type-safe SQL queries with TypeScript errors when you reference a column or table that doesn't exist.

### Select 

The following example selects all rows of a `Comment` table. This returns the complete array of seeded development data from `db/seed.ts` which is then available for use in your page template:

```astro title="src/pages/index.astro"
---
import { db, Comment } from 'astro:db';

const comments = await db.select().from(Comment);
---

<h2>Comments</h2>

{
  comments.map(({ author, body }) => (
    <article>
      <p>Author: {author}</p>
      <p>{body}</p>
    </article>
  ))
}
```

<ReadMore>See the [Drizzle `select()` API reference](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/select) for a complete overview.</ReadMore>

### Insert

To accept user input, such as handling form requests and inserting data into your remote hosted database, configure your Astro project for [on-demand rendering](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/rendering-modes/#on-demand-rendered) and [add an SSR adapter](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/server-side-rendering/#official-adapters) for your deployment environment.

This example inserts a row into a `Comment` table based on a parsed form POST request:

```astro
---
// src/pages/index.astro
import { db, Comment } from 'astro:db';

if (Astro.request.method === 'POST') {
  // parse form data
  const formData = await Astro.request.formData();
  const author = formData.get('author');
  const content = formData.get('content');
  if (typeof author === 'string' && typeof content === 'string') {
    // insert form data into the Comment table
    await db.insert(Comment).values({ author, content });
  }
}

// render the new list of comments on each request
const comments = await db.select().from(Comment);
---

<form method="POST" style="display: grid">
	<label for="author">Author</label>
	<input id="author" name="author" />

	<textarea name="content"></textarea>

	<button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>

<!--render `comments`-->
```

TODO(fks): Add an API endpoint example? I find myself using this much more often. 

<ReadMore>

See the [Drizzle `insert()` API reference](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/insert) for a complete overview.

### Filtering

To query for table results by a specific property, use [Drizzle options for partial selects](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/select#partial-select). For example, add [a `.where()` call](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/select#filtering) to your `select()` query and pass the comparison you want to make. 

The following example queries for all rows in a `Comment` table that contain the phrase "Astro DB." Use [the `like()` operator](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/operators#like) to check if a phrase is present within the `body`:


```astro title="src/pages/index.astro"
---
import { db, Comment, like } from 'astro:db';

const comments = await db.select().from(Comment).where(
    like(Comment.body, '%Astro DB%')
);
---
```

All Drizzle utilities for building queries are exposed from the `astro:db` module. This includes:

- [Filter operators](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/operators) like `eq()` and `gt()`
- [Aggregation helpers](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/select#aggregations-helpers) like `count()`
- [The `sql` helper](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/sql) for writing raw SQL queries

```ts
import { eq, gt, count, sql } from 'astro:db';
```


### Relationships

You can query related data from multiple tables using a SQL join. To create a join query, extend your `db.select()` statement with a join operator. Each function accepts a table to join with and a condition to match rows between the two tables.

This example uses an `innerJoin()` function to join `Comment` authors with their related `Author` information based on the `authorId` column. This returns an array of objects with each `Author` and `Comment` row as top-level properties:

```astro title="src/pages/index.astro"
---
import { db, eq, Comment, Author } from 'astro:db';

const comments = await db.select()
  .from(Comment)
  .innerJoin(Author, eq(Comment.authorId, Author.id));
---

<h2>Comments</h2>

{
  comments.map(({ Author, Comment }) => (
    <article>
      <p>Author: {Author.name}</p>
      <p>{Comment.body}</p>
    </article>
  ))
}
```

See the [Drizzle join reference](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/joins#join-types) for all available join operators and config options.

## Astro Studio

<p style="margin: 0.25em;"><Badge variant="accent">Studio feature</Badge></p>

Astro DB can connect to the Astro Studio platform to quickly add a hosted database to your project. You can view, manage and deploy new hosted databases all from the Astro Studio web portal.

There are two ways to create a project in Astro Studio:
1. via the [Astro Studio CLI](/en/reference/cli-reference/#astro-studio-cli) using `astro link`
2. via the Astro Studio web UI 

To create a new database in the Astro Studio web UI, click the "create project" button in the header and follow the instructions presented. Astro Studio will walk you through the necessary steps, and at the end of the process you'll have a hosted database configured for your project.


### Pushing schemas

TODO(fks): Document `astro db push` and when you might need to run it 

### Pushing data 

TODO(fks): Document `astro db execute` and when you might need to run it

<ReadMore>

See the [CLI reference](/en/guides/integrations-guide/db/#cli-reference) for a complete list of commands.

</ReadMore>

### Connect to Astro Studio

<p style="margin: 0.25em;"><Badge variant="accent">Studio feature</Badge></p>

By default, Astro will use a local database file whenever you run the `dev` or `build` commands. Tables are recreated from scratch when each command is run, and development seed data will be inserted.

To connect to your hosted Studio database, you can add the `--remote` flag. Use this flag for production deploys to have both readable and writable access to your Studio database. This will allow you to [accept and persist user data](#insert-data-from-a-server-route).

```bash
# Build with a remote connection
astro build --remote

# Develop with a remote connection
astro dev --remote
```

:::caution

Be careful using `--remote` in development. This will connect to a live production database, and all inserts, updates, or deletions will be persisted.

:::

To use a remote connection, you will need an app token to authenticate with Studio. Visit the Studio dashboard for token creation and setup instructions.

## Building Astro DB integrations

[Astro integrations](/en/reference/integrations-reference/) can extend user projects with additional Astro DB tables and seed data.

Use the `extendDb()` method in the `astro:db:setup` hook to register additional Astro DB config and seed files.
The `defineDbIntegration()` helper provides TypeScript support and auto-complete for the `astro:db:setup` hook.

```js {8-13}
// my-integration/index.ts
import { defineDbIntegration } from '@astrojs/db/utils';

export default function MyIntegration() {
  return defineDbIntegration({
    name: 'my-astro-db-powered-integration',
    hooks: {
      'astro:db:setup': ({ extendDb }) => {
        extendDb({
          configEntrypoint: '@astronaut/my-package/config',
          seedEntrypoint: '@astronaut/my-package/seed',
        });
      },
      // Other integration hooks...
    },
  });
}
```

Integration [config](#configuration) and [seed](#seed-development-data) files follow the same format as their user-defined equivalents.

### Type safe operations in integrations

While working on integrations, you may not be able to benefit from Astro’s generated table types exported from `astro:db`.
For full type safety, use the `asDrizzleTable()` utility to create a table reference object you can use for database operations.

For example, given an integration setting up the following `Pets` database table:

```js
// my-integration/config.ts
import { defineDb, defineTable, column } from 'astro:db';

export const Pets = defineTable({
  columns: {
    name: column.text(),
    species: column.text(),
  },
});

export default defineDb({ tables: { Pets } });
```

The seed file can import `Pets` and use `asDrizzleTable()` to insert rows into your table with type checking:

```js {2,7} /typeSafePets(?! )/
// my-integration/seed.ts
import { asDrizzleTable } from '@astrojs/db/utils';
import { db } from 'astro:db';
import { Pets } from './config';

export default async function() {
  const typeSafePets = asDrizzleTable('Pets', Pets);

  await db.insert(typeSafePets).values([
    { name: 'Palomita', species: 'cat' },
    { name: 'Pan', species: 'dog' },
  ]);
}
```

The value returned by `asDrizzleTable('Pets', Pets)` is equivalent to `import { Pets } from 'astro:db'`, but is available even when Astro’s type generation can’t run.
You can use it in any integration code that needs to query or insert into the database.
