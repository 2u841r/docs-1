Astro DB is a fully-managed SQL database designed for the Astro ecosystem: develop locally in Astro and deploy from your Astro Studio dashboard.

With [an Astro DB account](), you have a powerful, local, type-safe tool to query and model content as a relational database. View, manage and deploy your hosted remote data through your interactive Studio dashboard.

## Installation

Astro includes an `astro add` command to automate the setup of official integrations. If you prefer, you can [install integrations manually](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/#manual-install) instead.

Run one of the following commands in a new terminal window.

<PackageManagerTabs>
  <Fragment slot="npm">
  ```sh
  npx astro add db
    ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="pnpm">
  ```sh
  pnpm astro add db
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="yarn">
  ```sh
  yarn astro add db
  ```
  </Fragment>
 </PackageManagerTabs>

If you run into any issues using the automated installation command, [feel free to report them to us on GitHub](https://github.com/withastro/astro/issues) and install `@astrojs/db` manually instead.
