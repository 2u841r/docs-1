[StackEditPro](https://stackeditpro.io/) is an in-browser, WYSIWYG-style Markdown editor that can open, edit, and publish Markdown files in a GitHub or GitLab repository.

StackEditPro is a solution that allows contributors to collaborate on your Astro project's content files in a familiar, text-based format.

:::note
StackEditPro is a rework of the [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/) Markdown Editor with additional closed-source features geared towards professional workflows and enhanced productivity.
:::

## Prerequisites

- An existing Astro project.
- StackEditPro (no account needed) in a browser tab connected to your GitHub account.

## Using StackEditPro as a CMS alternative

You can use StackEditPro as a lightweight alternative to a Content Management System (CMS) to add, update and maintain content files (`.md` and `mdx`) in your Astro project. You can make content-only changes to your site without the need for any software installed nor a running server.

This provides a low-friction way to update your content, fix typos, or add collaborators who are unable to use a traditional coding environment. However, you will not receive any benefits of using a code editor, feedback such as warnings and errors while you work, nor a live preview of the published Astro site.

:::tip 
An online coding environment such as [Google IDX](https://idx.dev), [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com), or [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.dev) will provide you or your contributors with more features while editing Markdown than a WYSIWYG editor without requiring a full dev environment setup.

Your writers may already be familiar with file and folder structures from their computer's operating system, and may be able to navigate to and edit your content files in an online code editor with little friction!

### Adding new Markdown files to your Astro repo from StackEditPro

To add a new document to a linked Astro repo hosted on GitHub, first create a new note in StackEditPro then publish it to a file location within your repository. 

<Steps>
1. From your StackEditPro dashboard, create a new note.
2. Add page content to your note in Markdown, including any frontmatter YAML.
3. From the StackEdit logo menu, select `Synchronize > Save on GitHub`.
4. Provide the repository, filepath, and name of the new file, including file extension (`.md` or `.mdx`), as you would like it to appear in your Astro repo. You can optionally specify a branch.
5. When you have provided all the necessary information, select `OK` to commit the new file to your Astro repository.
6. To confirm that your changes have been successfully applied, you can visit your repository on GitHub.com and verify that the file content has been updated.
</Steps>

### Editing an existing file from your Astro repository in StackEditPro

You can edit any existing file from a linked GitHub repository by opening from GitHub. A new linked StackEditPro note will be created in your dashboard.

<Steps>
1. From the StackEdit logo menu, select `Synchronize > Open from GitHub`.
2. Provide the repository, filepath and name of the file, including file extension (`.md` or `.mdx`), as it exists in your Astro repo. You can optionally specify a branch.
3. StackEditPro will create a new local note in your dashboard using the name of the file as the title.
4. Make any desired changes to your content in the StackEditPro Markdown editor, including frontmatter YAML if needed.
5. When you are ready to publish your changes back to GitHub, `Synchronize` again.
6. To confirm that your changes have been successfully applied, you can visit your repository on GitHub.com and verify that the file content has been updated.
</Steps>

### Updating your Astro content from a linked StackEditPro note

You can update an existing StackEditPro note that has been linked to a file in your Astro repo, then push your changes back to your project. This is a convenient way for you or your collaborators to maintain and update the content of files that change regularly.

:::caution
When a StackEditPro note has been linked with a GitHub file, your local note is not automatically in sync with the GitHub version. Therefore, it is important to first `Synchronize` any changes to be sure you are working with an updated copy of your content.

If you `Synchronize` with local changes without pulling first, your file on GitHub (the "server" copy) will overwrite the contents of your local note to prevent data loss from your GitHub repository. A merge conflict report will be generated as a new StackEdit note in your dashboard with instructions for further options for data recovery.
:::

<Steps>
1. From your StackEditPro dashboard, open an existing linked note to edit it.
2. `Synchronize` your note first to pull in any new changes to the file hosted on GitHub.
3. Make any desired changes to your content in your StackEditPro editor, including frontmatter YAML if needed.
4. When you are ready to publish your changes back to GitHub, `Synchronize` again.
5. To confirm that your changes have been successfully applied, you can visit your repository on GitHub.com and verify that the file content has been updated.
