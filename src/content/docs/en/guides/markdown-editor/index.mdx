## Why use a Markdown editor?

Allow an easy way for people to edit content only files like Markdown and mdx. You can make changes to any Markdown or MDX file in your Astro repository by editing the file Markdown note in an editor in the browser. This allows you or a collaborator to edit, update your Astro site's content without a code editor or development environment.

## Other ways for content collaborators?

They can use IDX, Codespaces, GitHub UI etc. as Markdown editors to edit individual content files
