Many Astro projects keep their content in Markdown or MDX files. Markdown is a convenient language for composing text that includes additional symbols to represent common HTML text markup such as bold, lists, and headings.

Composing in Markdown does not require knowledge of HTML, nor any specific code editing, and can provide a convenient shorthand for formatted text content. Storing your content in Markdown files allows content collaborators on your Astro project of all programming abilities.

## Using an online Markdown editor as a CMS alternative

You can use an online markdown editor as a lightweight alternative to [using a Content Management System (CMS) with Astro](/en/guides/cms/) to add, update and maintain content files (`.md` and `mdx`) stored in your Astro project. This allows you or a collaborator to edit, update your Astro site's content in an editor in the browser without a code editor or development environment. This is a convenient way to make content-only changes to your site without the need for any software installed nor a running server.

This provides a low-friction way to update your content, fix typos, or add collaborators who are unable to use a traditional coding environment. However, you will not receive any benefits of using a code editor, feedback such as warnings and errors while you work, nor a live preview of the published Astro site.

:::tip 
An online coding environment such as [Google IDX](https://idx.dev), [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com), or [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.dev) will allow you or your contributors more features while editing Markdown than a WYSIWYG editor without requiring a full dev environment setup.

Your writers may already be familiar with file and folder structures from their computer's operating system, and may be able to navigate to and edit your content files in an online code editor with little friction!
