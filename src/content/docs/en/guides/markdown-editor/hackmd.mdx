[HackMD](https://hackmd.io/) is an online Markdown editor that can link with your GitHub account to edit, push, and pull `.md` and `.mdx` files from a GitHub-hosted repository.

HackMD supports advanced Markdown syntax, including tables, diagrams, and mathematical equations like LaTeX. MDX content can be edited, but will not be rendered in the Markdown preview. 

[HackMD Hub](https://github.com/apps/hackmd-hub) is a GitHub app that allows contributors with their own GitHub accounts to collaborate on your Astro project's content files from their own HackMD account, without the need for a full code editor or development environment.

## Prerequisites

- An existing Astro project hosted on GitHub.
- A free HackMD account connected to your GitHub account.
- (optional) HackMD Hub configured on your GitHub account or organziation to allow additional GitHub contributors.

## Using HackMD as a CMS

You can use HackMD as a lightweight Content Management System (CMS) to add, update and maintain content files (`.md` and `mdx`) in your Astro project. You can make content-only changes to your site without the need for any software installed nor a running server.

This provides a low-friction way to update your content, fix typos, or add collaborators who are unable to use a traditional coding environment. However, you will not receive any benefits of using a code editor, feedback such as warnings and errors while you work, nor a live preview of the published Astro site.

:::tip 
An online coding environment such as [Google IDX](https://idx.dev), [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com), or [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.dev) will allow you or your contributors more features while editing Markdown than a WYSIWYG editor without requiring a full dev environment setup.

Your writers may already be familiar with file and folder structures from their computer's operating system, and may be able to navigate to and edit your content files in an online code editor with little fricion!

### Creating a new file in your repository from HackMD

To add a new document to a linked Astro repo hosted on GitHub, create a new note in HackMD then publish it to a location within your repository.

<Steps>
1. From your HackMD dashboard, create a new note.
2. Give your note a title. This does not have to be the name of the file to be added to your repository. However, you may find it convenient for organizing and identifying your notes if the title matches the filename.
3. Add page content to your note in Markdown, including any frontmatter YAML.
4. From the menu, select `Options > Versions and GitHub sync`. You will see a message that the file is not linked to GitHub, but will have the option to `Push to GitHub`.
5. Select the option to `Push to GitHub`, and confirm the option to `Switch Now` so that [line breaks will be rendered consistently across HackMD and GitHub](https://hackmd.io/s/link-with-github#Line-Break-Rendering-Rules).
6. Choose which file to push to. This will be the name of the file, including file extension (`.md` or `.mdx`), as you would like it to appear in your Astro repo. Fill the input fields to select a linked repository, branch, and file name. You can navigate your existing repositories and folders by selecting from drop down options, or typing directly.
7. Choose to push the contents of your HackMD note in its current status (default), or choose any previously saved versions of your note. It is not necessary to include your HackMD title or tags. These are only for HackMD organization and do not appear in your file on GitHub.
8. Optionally provide a commit message and description that will override the default message.
9. When you have provided all the necessary information, select `Push` to commit the new file to your Astro repository. 
10. To confirm that your changes have been successfully applied, you can visit your repository on GitHub.com and verify that the new file exists.
</Steps>

### Creating a new HackMD note from an existing file in your repository

You can edit any existing file from a linked GitHub repository by creating a new HackMD note from a GitHub import.

<Steps>
1. From your HackMD dashboard, use the additional menu item `import a file from GitHub` when creating a new note. (Alternatively, any new, blank note will display an option in the text editing field to pull or push from GitHub. You can select `Pull from GitHub` at this time.)
2. Select the repository, branch, and filename of the file you want to edit in HackMD.
3. HackMD will display the differences between the two files: the content of the file you have selected and the empty HackMD note. Select `Apply all changes` to update your existing HackMD note with the content from GitHub.
4. Give your note a title, and add any desired tags to organize your content in your HackMD dashboard. Note: these are only for local organization and will not be represented on GitHub or in your file's content. Your title does not have to match the filename, though you may wish to do so for easier identification of your HackMD documents.
5. Make any desired edits to your file's content, including frontmatter YAML if needed.
6. When you are ready to publish your changes back to GitHub, use the menu to select `Options > Versions and GitHub Sync`.
7. Select the option to `Push to GitHub`, and if necessary, confirm the option to `Switch Now` so that [line breaks will be rendered consistently across HackMD and GitHub](https://hackmd.io/s/link-with-github#Line-Break-Rendering-Rules).
8. Optionally provide a commit message and description that will override the default message.
9. When you have provided all the necessary information, select `Push` to commit the new file to your Astro repository. 
10. To confirm that your changes have been successfully applied, you can visit your repository on GitHub.com and verify that the file content has been updated.
</Steps>

### Updating your Astro content from a linked HackMD note

You can update an existing HackMD note that has been linked to a file in your Astro repo, then push your changes back to your project. This is a convenient way for you or your collaborators to maintain and update your content.

:::caution
When a HackMD note has been linked with a GitHub file, your local note is not automatically in sync with the GitHub version. Therefore, it is important to first `Pull` any changes to be sure you are working with an updated copy of your content. If you `Push` changes without pulling, you will overwrite the GitHub file with the contents of your local note.
:::

<Steps>
1. From your HackMD dashboard, open the note to edit it.
2. Use the menu to select `Options > Versions and GitHub Sync`. Select `Pull` to import any changes made to the file on GitHub.
  
    The `Pull` option should show a symbol (small dot) if there are changes in the source file on GitHub that need to be pulled. Even if it does not, it is always safe to `Pull` from GitHub and verify that any changes there will update your local HackMD copy. You can `Pull` even if there are no changes to be made.

3. Make any desired changes to your content in your HackMD editor, including frontmatter YAML if needed.
4. When you are ready to publish your changes back to GitHub, use the menu to select `Options > Versions and GitHub Sync`.
5. Select the option to `Push to GitHub`, and if necessary, confirm the option to `Switch Now` so that [line breaks will be rendered consistently across HackMD and GitHub](https://hackmd.io/s/link-with-github#Line-Break-Rendering-Rules).
6. Optionally provide a commit message and description that will override the default message.
7. When you have provided all the necessary information, select `Push` to commit the new file to your Astro repository.
8. To confirm that your changes have been successfully applied, you can visit your repository on GitHub.com and verify that the file content has been updated.
</Steps>

## Example: Add a new blog post

You can write blog posts in HackMD and then publish these notes as files in your Astro repository on GitHub. However, a Markdown editor will not perform any checks on your content, nor will it show you a preview of your entire Astro site, only the Markdown content itself.

Since you do not have access to a full coding environment, a dev server, nor a terminal, you and your collaborators will not be able to see any error messages if the content of your files is improperly formatted or does not conform to your required collection schema.

Therefore, a [HackMD note template](https://hackmd.io/s/how-to-use-template) is useful for starting a new note with your frontmatter fields matching your blog post schema already included. This way, you or your contributors will be prompted to properly format a content collection entry and reduce the chance of misformed entries.

This example will first create a blog post template matching a content collection schema, then create and publish a new blog post.

<Steps>
1. From your HackMD dashboard, use the additional menu item `New note from template` when creating a new note. (Alternatively, any new, blank note will display an option in the text editing field to start from a template. You can select `more templates` at this time.)
2. Select `Create a new template` instead of choosing an existing template. Give your template a name (e.g. `blog post`) and save it.
3. Delete the automatically-created title and instead, add any necessary frontmatter YAML for your project's blog post in the HackMD template.

    You can check a previous blog post, or your `src/content.config.ts` collection schema. For a schema that requires a title, author, date, and tags, then add the following frontmatter properties to your template:

    ```md
    ---
    title:
    author:
    date: 2024-12-31
    tags: []
    ---
    ```

    :::tip
    Include any syntax or formats that might be helpful to have pre-filled so you don't have to remember them.
    :::
4. Your template is automatically saved as you write. When you are finished, return to your dashboard without saving and the new template will be ready for use.
5. From your HackMD dashboard, use the additional menu item `New note from template` when creating a new note. (Alternatively, any new, blank note will display an option in the text editing field to start from a template. You can select `more templates` at this time.)
6. This time, select your new `blog post` template and a new note will be created with your frontmatter properties included.
7. Fill in values for your frontmatter properties and write your blog post.
8. Follow the instructions to [publish this note as a new file in your Astro repository (starting at Step 2)](#creating-a-new-file-in-your-repository-from-hackmd).
9. To confirm that your blog post published successfully, visit your site or check your deploy host's logs. If there were any errors that can be fixed by updating the YAML/Markdown content, you can make changes to the HackMD note and `Push` changes back to GitHub. Otherwise, you may need to use a code editor to update your site.
