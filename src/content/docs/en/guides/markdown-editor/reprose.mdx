[Reprose](https://reprose.pp.ua/) is an open-source, online, in-browser Markdown editor that links with your GitHub account to edit `.md` and `.mdx` files in your repositories.


## Prerequisites

- An existing Astro project hosted on GitHub.
- Reprose (no account needed) in a browser tab connected to your GitHub account.

## Using Reprose as a CMS alternative

You can use Reprose as a minimal alternative to a Content Management System (CMS) to manage content files (`.md` and `mdx`) in your Astro project. You can make content-only changes to your site without the need for any software installed nor a running server.

This provides a low-friction way to add or update content or fix typos when you are unable to use a traditional coding environment. However, you will not receive any benefits of using a code editor, feedback such as warnings and errors while you work, nor a live preview of the published Astro site.

:::tip 
An online coding environment such as [Google IDX](https://idx.dev), [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com), or [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.dev) will provide you or your contributors with more features while editing Markdown than a WYSIWYG editor without requiring a full dev environment setup.

Your writers may already be familiar with file and folder structures from their computer's operating system, and may be able to navigate to and edit your content files in an online code editor with little friction!

### Adding new Markdown files to your Astro repo from Reprose

To add a new document to the default branch of a linked Astro repo hosted on GitHub, first select a repository, then create a new document.

<Steps>
1. Search for or select the name of the repository you want to add a file.
2. Navigate to the folder where your new file will go and choose `+ Create` to create a new document.
3. Provide a file name, including file extension (`.md` or `.mdx`), as you would like it to appear in your Astro repo.
4. Make any desired changes to your content in the Reprose Markdown editor, including frontmatter YAML if needed.
5. When you are ready to publish your changes back to GitHub, select `Save`.
6. Optionally, update the commit message provided and whether or not to skip any continuous integration (CI) processes.
7. Select "Push commit" to publish your changes to your Astro repository on GitHub.
8. To confirm that your changes have been successfully applied, you can visit your repository on GitHub.com and verify that the file content has been updated.
