[Reprose](https://reprose.pp.au/) is an open-source, online, in-browser Markdown editor that can link with your GitHub account to edit, push, and pull `.md` and `.mdx` files from a GitHub-hosted repository.
{/* 
## Prerequisites

- An existing Astro project hosted on GitHub.
- Dillinger (no account needed) in a browser tab connected to your GitHub account.

## Using Dillinger as a CMS alternative

You can use Dillinger as a minimal alternative to a Content Management System (CMS) to edit and update existing content files (`.md` and `mdx`) in your Astro project. You can make content-only changes to your site without the need for any software installed nor a running server.

This provides a low-friction way to update your content or fix typos when you are unable to use a traditional coding environment. However, you will not receive any benefits of using a code editor, feedback such as warnings and errors while you work, nor a live preview of the published Astro site.

:::tip 
An online coding environment such as [Google IDX](https://idx.dev), [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com), or [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.dev) will allow you or your contributors more features while editing Markdown than a WYSIWYG editor without requiring a full dev environment setup.

Your writers may already be familiar with file and folder structures from their computer's operating system, and may be able to navigate to and edit your content files in an online code editor with little friction!

### Creating a new Dillinger note from an existing file in your repository

You can edit any existing file from a linked GitHub repository by creating a new Dillinger note from a GitHub import.

<Steps>
1. From your Dillinger dashboard, use the `Import from` menu item and select `GitHub`.
2. Select the organization, repository, branch, and then finally filename of the file you want to edit in Dillinger.
3. A new note will be created using the filename as the title.
4. Make any desired edits to your file's content, including frontmatter YAML if needed.
5. When you are ready to publish your changes back to GitHub, use the `Save to` menu to select `GitHub`.
6. Provide a commit message and select `Commit`. This will push your changes back to your Astro repository. 
7. To confirm that your changes have been successfully applied, you can visit your repository on GitHub.com and verify that the file content has been updated.
</Steps>

### Updating your Astro content from a linked Dillinger note

You can update an existing Dillinger note that has been linked to a file in your Astro repo, then push your changes back to your project **as long as no change has been made to the original file**. (You will receive an error message when trying to save if changes have been made to the source file.) Therefore, you should only maintain an existing Dillinger note for multiple edits if you are the only person editing this file.

Otherwise, you should import the latest version of the file from GitHub every time you want to make a change to a document, then delete your local Dillinger note when you have published your changes.

### Creating a new file in your repository from Dillinger

It is not possible to create a new file in your repository from Dillinger. You can only [import and an existing file](#creating-a-new-dillinger-note-from-an-existing-file-in-your-repository). */}
