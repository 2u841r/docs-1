[GitHub](https://github.com/) provides an online, in-browser Markdown editor that allows you to edit your `.md` and `.mdx` content files from a GitHub-hosted repository.

## Prerequisites

- An existing Astro project hosted on GitHub.

## Using GitHub Web as a CMS alternative

You can use the GitHub website as a minimal Content Management System (CMS) to edit and update existing content files (`.md` and `mdx`) in your Astro project. You can make content-only changes to your site without the need for any software installed nor a running server.

This provides a low-friction way to update your content, fix typos, or add collaborators who are unable to use a traditional coding environment. However, you will not receive any benefits of using a code editor, feedback such as warnings and errors while you work, nor a live preview of the published Astro site.

:::tip 
An online coding environment such as [Google IDX](https://idx.dev), [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com), or [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.dev) will allow you or your contributors more features while editing Markdown than a WYSIWYG editor without requiring a full dev environment setup.

Your writers may already be familiar with file and folder structures from their computer's operating system, and may be able to navigate to and edit your content files in an online code editor with little fricion!

### Editing an existing file in your Astro repository on GitHub web

You can edit any existing file from a linked GitHub repository navigating through the repository file structure, then selecting "edit" while viewing any file.

<Steps>
1. From the main URL of your Astro repository hosted on GitHub, select the `src` folder of the project. This will take you into the "Files" view of the repository and provide a sidebar for navigating its folder structure.
2. If you want to edit a file on a different branch, select the appropriate branch from the dropdown menu.
3. In the sidebar, navigate through the folders (e.g. `src/content/docs/`) until the file you wish to edit is visible and select it.
4. When viewing the file's preview, select the "edit this file" option (pencil icon). By default, "edit in place" will be selected.
5. Make any desired edits to your file's content, including frontmatter YAML if needed.
6. When you are ready to publish your changes, select `Commit changes...` and optionally, provide a different commit message and/or description.
7. Select whether to commit changes directly to the branch, or to create a new branch and start the process to create a pull request (PR) before submitting `Commit changes`.
8. If you committed directly, the file content will now be updated. Otherwise, you will continue the steps to submit a PR and your changes will be reviewed before merging.
</Steps>

### Creating a new file in your Astro repository from GitHub web

<Steps>

1. In the sidebar of the "Files" view of your repository, navigate to the branch and folder where you would like to add a new file. (e.g. `src/content/docs/`)
2. Select the option to add a new file (`+` icon near the displayed branch name).
3. In the selected text input area, confirm the file path displayed and provide a file name, including extension. (e.g. `new-guide.md`) 
4. Add your file content, including frontmatter YAML if needed.
5. When you are ready to publish your changes back to GitHub, select `Commit changes...` and optionally, provide a different commit message and/or description.
6. Select whether to commit changes directly to the branch, or to create a new branch and start the process to create a pull request (PR) before submitting `Commit changes`.
7. If you committed directly, the file content will now be updated. Otherwise, you will continue the steps to submit a PR and your changes will be reviewed before merging.
