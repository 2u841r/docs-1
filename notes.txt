NEW PLAN:
    reference docs live in the docs repo
        content collection!
        seperate MD files for everything, with frontmatter for the metadata
    in the main repo, remove docs from JSDoc, have an @auto-inject
        auto-inject runs during build, fetches from URL probably
        OR stays small and focused, like today.
        
        
        
√ Configuration
    - src/@types/astro.ts
X CLI
    - Can the docs site run each command in `--help` mode to generate?
    - otherwise, will need so way to get description and such out
O Runtime API
    - src/@types/astro.ts (AstroGlobal)
O Integrations API
    - src/@types/astro.ts (AstroIntegration)
    - probably needs a guide for how to build an integration
O Adapter API
    - src/@types/astro.ts (AstroAdapter)
    - probably needs a guide for how to build an adapter
O Template Directives
    - src/@types/astro.ts (AstroBuiltinProps, AstroBuiltinAttributes)
    - combine builtin props + attributes into a single interface
√ Error Reference
    - src/errors/error-data.ts
    - uses @doc
